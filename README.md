## Overview

**MyLibrary** is a Windows Forms desktop application developed in C# using the .NET framework. The application helps a small library manage its books and borrower records, implementing key event-driven programming principles and database integration using ADO.NET.

## Features

### Login System
- Secure login screen using a `Users` table.
- Redirects to the main application on successful login.
- Displays error on invalid credentials.

### Books Management
- View all books in a `DataGridView`.
- Add, edit, and delete books.
- Input validation for title, author, year, and available copies.

### Borrowers Management
- Manage library members: view, add, edit, and delete borrowers.
- Input validation for name, email, and phone number.

### Issue/Return System
- Issue a book to a borrower (decrements `AvailableCopies`).
- Return a book (increments `AvailableCopies`).
- Tracks issued books in an `IssuedBooks` table with `IssueDate` and `DueDate`.

### Bonus Features
- Filter books by author or year range.
- Generate a report of overdue books (`DueDate < Today`).

    - `Books`
    - `Borrowers`
    - `IssuedBooks`
